\section{Introduction}

This is a reflective report that proposes three weaknesses that occurred during the second semester projects, then suggests how these issues could be overcome for future projects.

\section{Weakest Key Skills}

\subsection{Weakness One: Communication in group projects}

%\subsection{Description} 
In semester two we had a large group project that was to make a desktop game with a group of four. This was the first time I have been working on a game collaboratively and I felt that a lot could of been improved for future projects.

%\subsection{Interpretation} 
Communication is vital to being an effective team in group projects, however in our group project there was almost no communication for the first 2 months of the project, and only in the last week of the project did we start communicating.

%\subsection{Outcome} 

To overcome this, I am planning to do a fairly large summer games project with five friends from back home, and hopefully I will learn more group communication skills from this. Furthermore

\subsection{Weakness Two: Motivation}

%\subsection{Description} 
Even though I do enjoy programming, I do still sometimes find it hard to motivate myself to work, especially when it can seem very daunting. 

%\subsection{Interpretation} 

For example, I struggled with trying to get std::vector to store values of the neighboring cells in the group game, thus this demotivated me a lot to work on the group project as I felt I was unable to do it.

%\subsection{Outcome} 
To overcome this, over the summer I will read up on C++ programming and try to implement some of the more complex programming structures  that I struggled with within the group game I am going to be making.

\subsection{Weakness Three: Requesting Support from Peers and Tutors}

%\subsection{Description} 

When I was working on the coding task 2 for the group game project, I was stuck with trying to work out which cell that the user clicked on.

%\subsection{Interpretation} 

This could of easily been avoided if I asked my team or my tutors for help with this problem early on, instead of spending a few weeks trying to work it out myself.


%\subsection{Outcome} 

To try and resolve this problem in the future, over the course of the summer and the first semester next year I will attempt to communicate my issues when I know i am stuck on a problem. Furthermore this will hopefully be resolved when we actually have a scrum master that I can communicate this to.
