# comp110-evaluation

##Semester Two:

###Week 1 

In the first week we were introduced to the new modules that we will be working on for this semester, the hardware hacking assignment looks like it will be fun as I quite like dealing with computer hardware.
We had a guest lecture from prof Simon Colton on computational creativity that I found really inspiring.

We also transitioned to C++ from python which is quite a bit different, but I feel confident that I can apply what I have learnt from python into C++.

To help further my study on C++ I rented a book on C++ by D.S. MALIK from the library.

I've also been working on Worksheet 4 and I've managed to get the Mandelbrot working first, however I did run into a few issues when trying to get it to work, so I used some online resources for guidance when I got a bit lost . Alothough I found the terminal hacking a lot easier to finish.

###Week 2
This week I received my makey makey kit and play dough and we started looking at prototyping and HCI for our controllers and why HCI is important. I also played all of the BA games they created last semester and chose one to design my controller for.

On Wednesday we had a lecture on how to use GitHub effectively in a team, which was very useful and I feel I now have a clear idea how to effectively use GitHub for the comp 150 group project.

We had our game pitches which I found very stressful as I'm not a good public speaker and I get very nervous. For the presentation I had my notes in a word document, and I feel that if I had made it into a power point, the presentation would of had a better flow, and I would of not missed as much stuff out.

###Week 3
In week 3 we had more lectures on SDL and C++ some of which I'm struggling to get my head around, especially getting my head around pointers and how to set things up in SDL.


To help overcome this problem I got a book on SDL game development that gives examples of how to set up SDL in visual studio and how to get started.

For my game controller I did some market research on existing game controllers and I'm going to try and make my controller with a minimalist design such as the wii nunchuck.

###Week 4
This week I tried to work on the A* search pathfinding algorithm, but I really struggled to try and find how to start, I tried to follow the pseudo code given to us but I'm still very unsure how to proceed.

One challenge I faced in week 4 was that the play dough for my controller dried and I was unable to re-shape it, so I think I may need to go the shops and buy some more play dough so I can re-design my controller for the next sprint.

###Week 5
For my controller I decided to move away from play dough, to a less conductive material, as the play dough was causing me a lot of issues by trying to separate the controller from the buttons. In the end I decided to move to cardboard for my controller.

Furthermore in week 5 my comp150 group worked on the first sprint of our game and managed to get a grid based system working.

###Week 6
I was ill for most of week 6 but I made it to the comp140 hardware submission on Monday where we had to demonstrate how our controllers work in class. 

As I was ill I went through the slides online and tried to research as much as possible.

###Week 7
Week 7 we covered IP and the laws that govern it, I found this very helpful as I didn't know much about it and I feel it is very important to know, although some of it was quite confusing and I found a lot of it was quite hard to digest.

This week I have been trying to catch up on the material I missed in the previous week and I am finding it quite hard to juggle so many projects at once.
